# VR-Stage-Lighting-CustomUI

This repository contains modified prefab & script for the [VR-Stage-Lighting](https://github.com/AcChosen/VR-Stage-Lighting) package made by myself.

# Installation
> [!WARNING]
> This is made only for [VR-Stage-Lighting release 2.7.1](https://github.com/AcChosen/VR-Stage-Lighting/releases/tag/v2.7.1) (This means if you have a different version, things may break.)

> [!WARNING]
> This modification mostly uses TextMeshPro for fancy Text instead of simple Unity Text component. While it's not required to have all text fields referenced in VRSL_LocalUIControlPanel component, it is required to have TextMeshPro installed in your project.

> [!CAUTION]
> BACKUP YOUR PROJECT BEFORE USING THIS MODIFICATION! I have no idea how it will complain in your environment or if it's backwards compatible.

1. VRChat Creator Companion
 - You can just copy `Packages` folder from this repository into `YourProject/Packages`.
2. Default Unity (?)
 - But if you are using unitypackage then you probably need to copy over folder `Packages/com.acchosen.vr-stage-lighting` into `YourProject/Assets` folder. (I'm not sure about this method as I use VCC)
To install you have to just copy Packages folder from this repository and put it into your unity project.
