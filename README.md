# VR-Stage-Lighting-CustomUI

This repository contains modified prefab & script for the [VR-Stage-Lighting](https://github.com/AcChosen/VR-Stage-Lighting) package made by myself.

# Installation
> [!WARNING]
> This is made only for [VR-Stage-Lighting release 2.8.0](https://github.com/AcChosen/VR-Stage-Lighting/releases/tag/v2.8.0) (This means if you have a different version, things may break.)

> [!WARNING]
> This modification mostly uses TextMeshPro for fancy Text instead of simple Unity Text component. While it's not required to have all text fields referenced in VRSL_LocalUIControlPanel component, it is required to have TextMeshPro installed in your project.

> [!CAUTION]
> BACKUP YOUR PROJECT BEFORE USING THIS MODIFICATION! I have no idea how it will complain in your environment or if it's backwards compatible.

Depending on where located [VR-Stage-Lighting](https://github.com/AcChosen/VR-Stage-Lighting) in your project, you have to replace script & add prefab.
